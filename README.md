# VISITOR-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
PROJECTS
When a visitor arrives, the system captures their image through a camera and compares it with the existing database using facial recognition algorithms (e.g., OpenCV and machine learning models). If the face matches a registered profile, the visitor is granted access automatically. If the visitor is unregistered, the system records their image and details, and immediately notifies the owner or concerned person via email, SMS, or app notification
